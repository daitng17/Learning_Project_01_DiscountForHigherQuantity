# Python-Ind-Learning-Project_01

Hi. My name is Nguyen Dai Truong Thanh. I have started learning Python for Data Science by myself recently. 

Ind Learning Project is my personal coding challenge. I will keep sharing my code on GitHub for review purposes.

Also this repo is a means to share my learning progress with my Professors and with my friends.

-Progress- This is my first repository after 5 days of learning Python.
